                <h2>Why Creativity Matters</h2>
                <p>Creativity is not just for artists, writers, or musicians; it's a crucial skill for problem-solving, innovation, and adapting to new challenges in every field.

This section will delve into how these brain areas interact during creative activities and how different types of thinking, such as convergent and divergent thinking, contribute to creative outputs.</p>
